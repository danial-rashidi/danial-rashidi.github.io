In the past, the internet was a place for people to showcase their creativity and thoughts freely. But today, with the Centralized Web and the domination of the internet by a few large corporations, what has happened to our privacy, freedom, and innovation?
What is the Centralized Web?

The Centralized Web means that large companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc., have taken control of a massive percentage of global internet traffic. Their websites dominate, and there is little to no competition for them.
Privacy

One of the risks of centralization is our privacy. For example, Microsoft and Google collect our data, including personal data, for training their AI bots or selling it to ad companies without our permission.
Censorship and Content Control

Another risk of centralization is that these big websites can remove or display whatever content they want based on their company policies. For example, when I was using X (formerly Twitter), I reported a tweet about hating the USA and Democrats, and after I reported that post, they banned me for it.
The Impact on Innovation

With this new internet, we donâ€™t really see creativity anymore because you just have to follow trends. Creativity and innovation are not as valued. For example, if you run a YouTube channel, you have to follow what other people are doing. If you introduce creativity in your videos, your views might be lower.
What are the Solutions?

One solution is to run your own website or blog. These days, with tools like WordPress and blog generators, creating your own content on your own platform is easy and accessible. Another solution is to use alternatives. For example, instead of using X, you can use Mastodon, or instead of using Google, you can use DuckDuckGo as your search engine.
Conclusion

The risks and dangers of the Centralized Web are serious. If you care about your privacy and freedom, like I do, consider running your own website or using alternative platforms. The future is decentralized, and together, we can build that future.
