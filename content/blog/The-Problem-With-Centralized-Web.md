In the past, the internet was a place for people to express their creativity and thoughts freely. However, today, with the rise of the Centralized Web and the dominance of a few large corporations, what has happened to our privacy, freedom, and innovation?

## What is the Centralized Web?

The Centralized Web refers to the control of a significant portion of global internet traffic by a few large companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and others. These companies dominate the web, and there is little to no competition against them.

## Privacy

One of the major risks of centralization is the loss of privacy. Companies like Microsoft and Google collect vast amounts of our data, including personal information, often without our consent. This data is used to train AI models or is sold to advertising companies without our permission.

## Censorship and Content Control

Another risk of centralization is the ability of these large platforms to control content. They can remove or promote whatever they want based on their company policies. For example, when I was using X (formerly Twitter), I reported a tweet criticizing the USA and Democrats. Instead of addressing the post, they banned me for reporting it.

## The Impact on Innovation

With this new internet landscape, creativity is stifled. You have to follow trends to succeed, and innovation is no longer valued. For instance, if you run a YouTube channel, you are pressured to follow what everyone else is doing. If you try to add creativity to your content, your views will likely be lower.

## What are the Solutions?

One solution is to run your own website or blog. Today, tools like WordPress and static site generators make creating and managing your own content easier and more accessible than ever. Another solution is to use alternatives. For example, instead of using X, you could use Mastodon, or instead of Google, try DuckDuckGo as your search engine.

## Conclusion

The risks and dangers of the Centralized Web are real and serious. If you care about your privacy and freedom, like I do, consider running your own website or using alternative platforms. The future is decentralized, and we can build that future together.
